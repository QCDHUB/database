#: name: Table 3
#: description: The measured normalized combined (electron and muon channels) cross section (1/SIG(FID))*D(SIG(FID))/DPT(Z) for 0 <= ABS(YRAP(Z)) < 1, 1 <= ABS(YRAP(Z)) < 2 and 2 <= ABS(YRAP(Z)) < 2.4. The cross sections at Born and dressed levels are given as well as the relative statistical and systematic uncertainties for uncorrelated and correlated sources.
