#: name: Table 26
#: description: The values of $(1/\sigma)\,d\sigma/dp_T^{\ell\ell}$ in each bin of $p_T^{\ell\ell}$ for the electron and muon channels separately (for various generator-level definitions) and for the Born-level combination in the kinematic region $ 46 \textrm{ GeV} \leq m_{\ell\ell} <  66 \textrm{ GeV},\ 0.0 \leq |y_{\ell\ell}| < 2.4$. The associated statistical and systematic (both uncorrelated and correlated between bins) are provided in percentage form.
