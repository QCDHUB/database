#: name: Auxiliary Figures 16 to 20
#: description: The measured normalized cross sections (left) in bins of Z pt in |y(Z)| bins, using born level leptons. The first bin (0-1 GeV) is not shown as large differences were observed in aMC@NLO and POWHEG predictions at Born level. The cross sections are divided by the bin width and then the distributions are normalized to 1.
