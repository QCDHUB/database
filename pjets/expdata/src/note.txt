according to the paper, part of the systematic uncertainties in STAR 2019 paper on 2012 data are uncorrelated

dataset 19999 is a test set of 10002 with no correlation treatment

dataset 20001 has mu set to be 
dataset 20002 has mu set to be 
dataset 20003 has mu set to be 

under key 'obs', '<' and '>' can only be used as pairs to represent averaging

'_c' means correlated uncertainty, '_u' means uncorrelated uncertainty, what precedes them does not matter to the code
