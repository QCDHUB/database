D0 dataset 10001 is ready for fitting
CDF dataset 10002 is ready for fitting
STAR MB dataset 10003 is ready for fitting
STAR HT dataset 10004 is ready for fitting

dataset 19999 is a test set of 10002 with no correlation treatment

dataset 10001 has mu set to be pt
dataset 10002 has mu set to be 0.5 pt
dataset 10003 has mu set to be pt

dataset 10001 does not have norm
dataset 10002 has norm but is fixed
dataset 10003 does not have norm
dataset 10004 does not have norm

unit conversion indicator has to be the same for the whole file, because the numeric unit conversion factor is read in only based on the first entry

dataset 10002 and 10003 uses cteq6

under key 'obs', '<' and '>' can only be used as pairs to represent averaging

'_c' and '_u' means correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties respectively
'%' means this uncertainty is a percentage
other parts are names for human reading

parton to hadron level correction will be multiplied to the data directly
so make sure values are of form one plus relavtive corrections

when either the systematic or statistical uncertainties have a positive and negative that are different in magnitude, only the one with a larger magnitude is written into the data file
