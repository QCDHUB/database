D0 dataset 10001 is ready for fitting
CDF dataset 10002 is ready for fitting
STAR MB dataset 10003 is ready for fitting
STAR HT dataset 10004 is ready for fitting

dataset 19999 is a test set of 10002 with no correlation treatment

dataset 10001 has mu set to be pt
dataset 10002 has mu set to be 0.5 pt
dataset 10003 has mu set to be pt

dataset 10001 does not have norm
dataset 10002 has norm but is fixed
dataset 10003 does not have norm
dataset 10004 does not have norm

unit conversion indicator has to be the same for the whole file, because the numeric unit conversion factor is read in only based on the first entry

dataset 10002 and 10003 uses cteq6
in dataset 10002, unfolding uncertainty is named as "%_defold_c" in order not to be confused with uncorrelation labels

under key 'obs', '<' and '>' can only be used as pairs to represent averaging

'_c' means correlated uncertainty, '_u' means uncorrelated uncertainty, what precedes them does not matter to the code

when either the systematic or statistical uncertainties have a positive and negative that are different in magnitude, only the one with a larger magnitude is written into the data file
